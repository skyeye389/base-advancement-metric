Call for Feedback and Collaboration

The Base Advancement (BA) and Base Advancement Prevention (BAP) metrics are released publicly at v1.0 as process-based measures of baserunner advancement and suppression.

This project is intentionally exploratory and methodologically transparent. Feedback from analysts, researchers, and baseball enthusiasts is welcome, particularly in the following areas:

Areas of Interest

Validation of BA/BAP behavior across larger or different samples

Edge cases in scoring logic or base–out state interpretation

Comparisons to existing metrics (e.g., RE24, WPA, LI-adjusted stats)

Applications to lineup construction, pitcher evaluation, or player development

Suggestions for secondary or derived metrics built on BA/BAP

Retrosheet-based ingestion and scaling strategies

What This Is (and Is Not)

BA/BAP are complementary, not replacement metrics

They intentionally exclude run and win context

Scoring logic is frozen at v1.0 to enable replication and critique
