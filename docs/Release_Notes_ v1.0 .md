Base Advancement Metric (BA/BAP) v1.0

This is the first public release of the Base Advancement (BA) and Base Advancement Prevention (BAP) metrics.

BA/BAP are state-based, process-oriented measures designed to quantify baserunner advancement and prevention independent of run or win context. Scoring logic is frozen at v1.0 and has been validated on a limited sample of 2022 Baltimore Orioles games.

This release includes a reproducible R engine, reporting templates, detailed scoring documentation, and illustrative example outputs. Baseball-Reference play-by-play exports were used for validation only; no automated scraping is performed.

Future work includes Retrosheet ingestion for league-scale analysis and secondary metrics incorporating run expectancy.
