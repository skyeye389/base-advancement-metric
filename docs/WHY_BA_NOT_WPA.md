# Why Base Advancement (BA) Is Not WPA

## Overview
Base Advancement (BA) and Win Probability Added (WPA) answer fundamentally different questions about baseball performance.

- **WPA** measures how much a play changed the probability of winning a specific game.
- **BA** measures how effectively a batter advanced existing baserunners, independent of score, inning, or leverage.

They are complementary, not competing, metrics.

## What WPA Measures
WPA is an outcome-based metric:
- Sensitive to game state (inning, score, outs)
- Highly context-dependent
- Ideal for describing *what mattered most* in a given game

A single late-inning home run can dominate WPA, even if the batter contributed little elsewhere.

## What BA Measures
BA is a process-based metric:
- Tracks baserunner movement caused by the batter
- Ignores win context intentionally
- Credits productive outs and penalizes erasures (e.g., double plays)

BA asks: *Did this plate appearance improve the offensive base–out state?*

## Why BA Ignores Win Context
BA removes leverage on purpose:
- Win context obscures repeatable skill
- Identical plays should receive identical credit
- Separation allows clean aggregation across games and seasons

Leverage can be reintroduced later via secondary analysis.

## When WPA Is Superior
- Narrative game analysis
- Identifying clutch moments
- Retrospective win attribution

---

## When BA Adds Value
- Evaluating situational hitting
- Identifying contact-first contributors
- Separating power from process
- Teaching base–out awareness

## Summary
WPA answers *"Who changed the outcome?"*  
BA answers *"Who improved the situation?"*

Both are valid. Neither replaces the other.
